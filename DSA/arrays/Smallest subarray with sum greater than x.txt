Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value. If such a subarray do not exist return 0 in that case.

Note: The answer always exists. It is guaranteed that x doesn't exceed the summation of a[i] (from 1 to N).

Example 1:

Input:
A[] = {1, 4, 45, 6, 0, 19}
x  =  51
Output: 3
Explanation:
Minimum length subarray is 
{4, 45, 6}

Example 2:
Input:
A[] = {1, 10, 5, 2, 7}
   x  = 9
Output: 1
Explanation:
Minimum length subarray is {10}
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function smallestSubWithSum() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer X as inputs and returns the required ouput.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N, x ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[] ≤ 104
